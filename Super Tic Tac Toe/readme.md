<h1> Super Tic Tac Toe </h1>
<p> Super Tic Tac Toe is an advanced version of the classic Tic Tac Toe game, featuring a larger grid composed of nine individual Tic Tac Toe boards. Players take turns placing their marks in the smaller boards, strategically aiming to win three squares in a row, column, or diagonal within each board. However, the catch is that the square a player selects dictates which mini board their opponent must play in next, adding a layer of strategy and complexity to the game. With its dynamic gameplay and enhanced strategic depth, Super Tic Tac Toe offers an exciting twist on a timeless classic.</p>
