## Sidebar

<p>
The sidebar is a user interface element typically found on the left or right side of a web page. It provides quick access to navigation links, settings, or other relevant content without taking up much space on the screen. In this implementation, HTML is used to structure the sidebar content, CSS to style its appearance and layout, and JavaScript to handle interactive behavior such as toggling its visibility.

Key Features:

Navigation Links: The sidebar contains links to different sections or pages of the website, allowing users to easily navigate between them.
Toggle Button: A toggle button is provided to expand or collapse the sidebar, allowing users to control its visibility based on their preference or screen size.
Customization: Developers can customize the sidebar's appearance, including its width, colors, icons, and animations, to match the overall design of the website or application.
Accessibility: The sidebar is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that it can be easily navigated and interacted with using keyboard shortcuts or screen readers for users with disabilities.
Technologies Used:

HTML: Used for structuring the sidebar content with semantic markup.
CSS: Used for styling the sidebar's appearance, including layout, colors, fonts, and animations.
JavaScript: Used for adding interactive behavior to the sidebar, such as toggling its visibility and handling user interactions.
