# Footer

##The footer is an essential component of a web page located at the bottom. It typically contains information about the website, contact details, navigation links, social media icons, and other relevant content. In this implementation, HTML is used to structure the footer content, CSS to style its appearance and layout, and JavaScript to handle interactive behavior such as form submissions, dynamic content updates, or animations.
